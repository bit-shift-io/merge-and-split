     * Adds a rotational force to a set of particles around a given point.
     * 
     * Torque (T) is the rotational equivalent of force and is calculated as:
     * Torque = radius x Force x sin(theta)
     * since we apply force perpendicular to the radius, sin(theta) = 1, so:
     * Torque = radius x Force
     * 
     * We want to find the force to apply to each particle to achieve the desired torque:
     * Force = Torque / radius
     * 
     * Suppose you want to apply a torque T = 100 NÂ·m to a wheel of radius R = 0.5m (points on the 
     * wheel range from r = 0 near the axle to r = 0.5 m at the rim).
     * At a point on the rim (r = 0.5m): F = 100 / 0.5 = 200 N.
