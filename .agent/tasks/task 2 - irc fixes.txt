IRC needs to keep a list of all users sorted alphabetically. The first in the list will be the master user.
The master user will respond first when a player posts their score into the chat.
The master user will take in this users score and add it to their leaderboard.
Once done, the master user will print their leaderboard into the chat channel.
Once this occurs, all other players will take in the master players leaderboard and update theirs.

Once this occurs, then the game should print the leaderboard results into the chat into a nicely formatted table.
The leaderboard should only keep the top 10 best times and be sorted by best time.
